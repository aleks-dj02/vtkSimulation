# Simulation of collision using VTK library

This is a group project for the course Interactive Engineering Graphics on the Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad.  

## Simulation  
This simulation uses semi-implicit Euler integration to simulate dynamics of spheres moving in two dimensions in a bounding box.  
Initial sphere positions and speeds are constant for each run. There is always one sphere which is immobile and three randomly placed cubes with which other spheres collide.

Simulation is started by pressing 'K'.
