# Simulation of collision using VTK library

This simulation uses semi-implicit Euler integration to simulate dynamics of spheres moving in two dimensions in a bounding box. 
There is always one sphere which is immobile and three randomly placed cubes with which other spheres collide.

Simulation is started by pressing 'K'.
